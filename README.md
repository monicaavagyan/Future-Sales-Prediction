## Project:  Future-Sales-Prediction

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `FutureSalesPrediction.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `FutureSalesPrediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook  file and the `advertising.csv` dataset file to complete your work.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `boston_housing/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
```bash
ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
The Advertising dataset consists of (200, 4) row & columns.We are going to  use the advertising dataset given in ISLR and analyse the relationship between 'TV,Radio & Newspaper advertising' and 'Sales' using a simple linear regression model. Each row in the dataset represents a different advertising campaign, and the columns represent various features related to those campaigns.



**Features**
1.  `TV`:  this column represents the amount of money spent on TV advertising (in thousands of dollars) for each campaign. It measures the advertising budget allocated to television commercials.
2. `Radio`: this column represents the amount of money spent on radio advertising (in thousands of dollars) for each campaign. It measures the advertising budget allocated to radio commercials.
3. `Newspaper`:  this column represents the amount of money spent on newspaper advertising (in thousands of dollars) for each campaign. It measures the advertising budget allocated to newspaper ads.

**Target Variable**
4. `Sales`:this column represents the sales generated (in thousands of units) as a result of each advertising campaign. It measures the effectiveness of the advertising in driving product sales.

This type of analysis helps businesses make informed decisions about how to allocate their advertising budgets for maximum sales impact.
